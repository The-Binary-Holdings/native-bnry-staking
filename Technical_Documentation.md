# Staking Contract - Technical Document

## Introduction
The `StakingContract` is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to enable users to stake BNRY tokens and earn rewards. The contract is built with security and efficiency in mind, leveraging industry-standard libraries and practices.

## System Overview
The Staking Contract allows users to deposit BNRY tokens into a pool managed by the contract. Users can withdraw their tokens at any time, subject to the balance available in their account. The contract ensures that staking and withdrawal operations are secure and transparent.

### Components
1. **Staking Mechanism:**
   - Users can deposit BNRY tokens by calling the `stake` function.
   - The contract tracks the total supply of staked tokens (`s_totalSupply`) and the number of stakers (`s_totalNumberStakers`).

2. **Withdrawal Mechanism:**
   - Users can withdraw their staked tokens by calling the `withdraw` function.
   - The contract ensures that users cannot withdraw more than they have staked and that only successful transfers are processed.

3. **Security:**
   - The contract uses the `ReentrancyGuard` from OpenZeppelin to prevent reentrancy attacks during staking and withdrawal operations.
   - Custom error messages (`TransferFailed`, `NeedsMoreThanZero`) are used for better error handling and gas efficiency.

## Data Structures
- **Mappings:**
  - `mapping(address => uint256) private s_balances;` - Tracks the staked balance of each user.

- **State Variables:**
  - `uint256 private s_totalSupply;` - The total amount of BNRY tokens staked in the contract.
  - `uint256 private s_totalNumberStakers;` - The total number of users who have staked tokens.

## Contract Methods
1. **stake():**
   - Allows users to stake BNRY tokens by sending them to the contract.
   - Updates the user’s balance and the total supply of staked tokens.
   - Emits a `Staked` event.

2. **withdraw(uint256 amount):**
   - Allows users to withdraw a specified a# Security Audit Scope - Staking Contract

## Audit Overview
The purpose of this audit is to assess the security, functionality, and efficiency of the `StakingContract`. This document outlines the scope of the audit and the goals to be achieved.

### Scope of the Audit

#### What will be audited?
- **Smart Contract:** The entire `StakingContract.sol` file will be audited.
- **Core Functions:**
  - `stake()`
  - `withdraw(uint256 amount)`
  - Getter functions: `getStaked(address account)`, `getTotalBalance()`, `getTotalNumberStakers()`

#### How will the audit be performed?
- **Static Analysis:** Automated tools will be used to scan for common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and access control issues.
- **Manual Code Review:** Each line of code will be manually reviewed to ensure compliance with best practices and to identify any potential security risks.
- **Testing:** Unit tests will be run to validate the correct functionality of the contract. Additional tests will be created to cover edge cases and ensure robustness.

### 2. Critical Modules
- **Staking Mechanism:** Focus on the logic for staking and ensuring that token balances are correctly handled.
- **Withdrawal Mechanism:** Ensure that users can only withdraw their own staked tokens and that funds are securely transferred.
- **Security Features:** Special attention will be given to the use of `ReentrancyGuard` and custom error handling.

### 3. Primary Goals
- **Security:** Identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities that could lead to loss of funds or unauthorized access.
- **Efficiency:** Ensure that the contract is optimized for gas usage and that unnecessary computations are avoided.
- **Compliance:** Verify that the contract complies with industry standards and best practices for DeFi smart contracts.

### 4. Specific Concerns
- **Reentrancy Attacks:** Ensure that the `ReentrancyGuard` is correctly implemented and that all functions are protected against reentrancy.
- **Gas Optimization:** Check for any possible gas savings, especially in frequently called functions.

## Conclusion
The audit will aim to thoroughly test and review the `StakingContract` to ensure it meets the highest standards of security and efficiency. The findings will be documented in a comprehensive audit report.
mount of their staked tokens.
   - Ensures that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the user’s balance.
   - Emits a `WithdrewStake` event.

## Error Handling
- The contract reverts transactions with meaningful error messages to prevent unexpected behavior and enhance security.

## Intended Functionality
The contract is designed to facilitate staking and withdrawal operations while maintaining security and efficiency. It is intended to be integrated into larger DeFi ecosystems where users can lock their BNRY tokens in exchange for rewards.
